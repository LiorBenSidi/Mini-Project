    "● Submission deadline: 08/08/23 at 23:55.\n",
    "○ The submission box in Moodle will close 48 hours after this deadline. To avoid\n",
    "penalties for late submissions (as stated in the syllabus), submit by this deadline.\n",
    "● Submission in pairs only (unless special permission is given by the head TA)\n",
    "● Submission must include (at least) two files (not a single zip):\n",
    "○ One jupyter notebook with your answers to parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 with both markdown\n",
    "and code cells. Markdown cells should contain brief explanations of your analyses.\n",
    "No need to elaborate in this file - you will do that in the PDF - but it should be clear\n",
    "enough that we know which questions the code relates to and what it does. Code\n",
    "cells must enable complete reproduction of all your results. Your code should be\n",
    "clearly documented.\n",
    "○ One PDF of exported content of your jupyter notebook. The PDF has to contain your\n",
    "outputs, similar to homework submission.\n",
    "○ One PDF file with your answers to part 5.\n",
    "○ You should merge the exported PDF and the PDF for part 5. You may use online free\n",
    "tools to do that, like: https://tools.pdf24.org/en/merge-pdf\n",
    "○ As listed in the syllabus, if you use generative AI tools, you must also submit a (third)\n",
    "docx file with details on your usage. Refer to the syllabus for details.\n",
    "● File names must be in the following format: final_project_ID1_ID2.pdf,\n",
    "final_project_ID1_ID2.ipynb .\n",
    "● You must adhere to the syllabus when you prepare and submit your work. Any deviation from\n",
    "the syllabus and/or guidelines herein will result in point deduction.\n",
    "● You can write in either Hebrew or English, but it’s better to use the language you are more\n",
    "comfortable with."
