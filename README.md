Project Steps:
1.	Population and Sample Selection:
•	Defined the target population.
•	Carefully selected a representative sample.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Assessed data quality, addressing missing values and outliers.
•	Utilized visualizations like histograms and scatter plots to understand distributions and relationships.
3.	Hypothesis Testing:
•	Formulated context-specific hypotheses.
•	Employed appropriate statistical tests to validate or negate null hypotheses.
4.	Classifier Construction:
•	Opted for the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm for classification.
•	Pre-processed data, including feature scaling and handling categorical variables.
•	Trained the chosen classifier on a training subset.
•	Assessed classifier performance using relevant metrics.
5.	Reflection and Documentation:
•	Created a comprehensive report detailing procedures.
•	Explained the rationale behind choices made.
•	Addressed challenges encountered and their solutions.
•	Presented EDA findings, hypothesis testing outcomes, and classifier insights.
•	Concluded with reflections on the experience and insights gained for future directions.

This project allowed us to apply data analysis concepts practically, gaining insights into real-world applications and challenges.
