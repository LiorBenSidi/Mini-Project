    "## Jury selection example: First inference problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1960’s, in Talladega County in Alabama, a black man called Robert Swain was convicted of raping a white woman and was sentenced to death. He appealed his sentence, citing among other factors the all-white jury. At the time, only men aged 21 or older were allowed to serve on juries in Talladega County. In the county, 26% of the eligible jurors were black, but there were only 8 black men among the 100 selected for the jury panel in Swain’s trial. No black man was selected for the trial jury.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1965, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Swain’s appeal. In its ruling, the Court wrote “… the overall percentage disparity has been small and reflects no studied attempt to include or exclude a specified number of Negroes.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population. Because 26% of the eligible population was black, 8 black men on a panel of 100 might seem low. **But is it too low?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Model\n",
    "One view of the way the real world generated the data – a model, in other words – is that the panel was selected at random and ended up with a small number of black men just due to chance. This model is consistent with what the Supreme Court wrote in its ruling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model specifies the details of a chance process. It says the data are like a random sample from a population in which 26% of the people are black. We are in a good position to assess this model, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can simulate data based on the model. That is, we can simulate drawing at random from a population of whom 26% are black.\n",
    "- Our simulation will show what a panel *would* look like *if* it were selected at random.\n",
    "- We can then compare the results of the simulation with the composition of Robert Swain’s panel.\n",
    "- If the results of our simulation are not consistent with the composition of Swain’s panel, that will be evidence against the model of random selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. What is the statistic that we want to simulate?\n",
    "2. Code generating one value of that statistic\n",
